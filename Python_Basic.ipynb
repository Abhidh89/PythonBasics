        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - Python is a high-level, interpreted,\n",
        "     general-purpose programming language. It's known for its readability and simplicity,making it easy to learn and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Popularity Reasons:\n",
        "     ○ Simple Syntax: Resembles English, making it beginner-friendly.\n",
        "     ○ Large Standard Library: Provides a vast collection of modules and functions for\n",
        "     various tasks.\n",
        "     ○ Strong Community Support: Extensive documentation and active community\n",
        "     help.\n",
        "     ○ Versatility: Used in web development, data science, AI, scripting, automation, and\n",
        "     more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - An interpreter is a program that directly executes\n",
        "instructions written in a programming language without compiling them into machine code\n",
        "first. Python is an interpreted language, meaning each line of code is translated and\n",
        "executed line by line\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Keywords are reserved words in Python\n",
        "that have special meanings and purposes. They cannot be used as identifiers (variable\n",
        "names, function names, etc.). Examples include if, else, for, while, def, class, import, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - No, keywords cannot be used as variable\n",
        "names. Using them as variable names will result in a syntax error.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Mutability refers to the ability of an object to be changed\n",
        "after it is created. Mutable objects can be modified in place without creating a new object.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.   Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Lists: Mutable. You can change their elements, add, or remove items after creation.\n",
        "     - Tuples: Immutable. Once created, you cannot change their elements. This\n",
        "     immutability makes them useful for storing data that should not be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.    What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - == (Equality Operator): Checks if the values of two operands are equal.\n",
        "      - is (Identity Operator): Checks if two operands refer to the same object in memory\n",
        "     (same memory address).\n",
        "\n",
        "8.    What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - Logical operators are used to combine\n",
        "        conditional statements. They are:\n",
        "      - and: Returns True if both operands are true.\n",
        "      - or: Returns True if at least one operand is true.\n",
        "      - not: Returns the opposite of the operand's boolean value.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.     What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Type casting (or type conversion) is the process of\n",
        "changing the data type of a variable from one type to another. Examples:\n",
        "       - int(): Converts to integer.\n",
        "       - float(): Converts to float.\n",
        "       - str(): Converts to string.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.     What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Implicit Type Casting (Coercion): Python automatically converts data types in certain\n",
        "situations. For example, when adding an integer and a float, Python automatically\n",
        "converts the integer to a float.\n",
        "       -  Explicit Type Casting: You manually convert data types using functions like int(), float(),\n",
        "str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.     What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "       - Conditional statements (like if, elif, else) allow you to execute different blocks of code based on\n",
        "whether certain conditions are true or false. They control the flow of execution in your program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.      How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "       - elif (short for \"else if\") is used to check multiple conditions sequentially. If the if condition is false,\n",
        "the elif conditions are checked in order. The first elif condition that evaluates to True will have its\n",
        "block of code executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.      What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "\n",
        "        - for Loop: Used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. You\n",
        "know the number of iterations in advance.\n",
        "        - while Loop: Used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
        "You may not know the number of iterations beforehand.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.     Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "      - A while loop is more suitable when you need to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is\n",
        "     met, but you don't know how many times the loop will need to run.\n",
        "Example: Reading user input until they enter a specific value:\n",
